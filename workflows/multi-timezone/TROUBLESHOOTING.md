# multi-timezone Troubleshooting

Reference: [ALFRED_WORKFLOW_DEVELOPMENT.md](../../ALFRED_WORKFLOW_DEVELOPMENT.md)

## Quick operator checks

1. Confirm latest package was used:
   - `scripts/workflow-pack.sh --id multi-timezone --install`
2. Confirm Alfred workflow variables are valid:
   - `TIMEZONE_CLI_BIN` (optional; executable timezone-cli override path)
   - `MULTI_TZ_ZONES` (optional; comma/newline separated IANA timezone IDs)
   - `MULTI_TZ_LOCAL_OVERRIDE` (optional; default `Europe/London`, used in local fallback mode)
3. Confirm script-filter contract output is JSON:
   - `bash workflows/multi-timezone/scripts/script_filter.sh "Asia/Taipei,America/New_York" | jq -e '.items | type == "array"'`
4. Confirm empty-query fallback behavior:
   - `MULTI_TZ_ZONES="" MULTI_TZ_LOCAL_OVERRIDE="Asia/Taipei" bash workflows/multi-timezone/scripts/script_filter.sh "" | jq -e '.items[0].uid == "Asia/Taipei"'`

## Common failures and actions

| Symptom in Alfred | Likely cause | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Invalid timezone` | Query/config includes non-IANA timezone IDs (for example typos such as `Asia/Taipe` or unsupported zones). | Replace with valid IANA timezone IDs (`Region/City`, for example `Asia/Taipei`) and keep comma/newline separators only. |
| `timezone-cli binary not found` | Packaged binary missing, `TIMEZONE_CLI_BIN` points to non-executable path, or runtime path resolution failed. | Re-pack workflow, or set `TIMEZONE_CLI_BIN` to an executable `timezone-cli` path and retry. |
| `Timezone runtime failure` | `timezone-cli` hit runtime/IO failure (timeout/internal error/panic). | Retry query, inspect stderr from `script_filter.sh`, and verify `timezone-cli` build/runtime integrity. |
| Empty `tz` query shows unexpected local timezone or `UTC` | Query and `MULTI_TZ_ZONES` are both empty, so fallback chain uses `MULTI_TZ_LOCAL_OVERRIDE` first (default `Europe/London`); terminal fallback is `UTC` when all probes fail. | Set `MULTI_TZ_ZONES` or `MULTI_TZ_LOCAL_OVERRIDE` for deterministic output; otherwise treat `UTC` as expected safe fallback. |

### macOS Gatekeeper fix

```bash
WORKFLOW_DIR="$(for p in "$HOME"/Library/Application\ Support/Alfred/Alfred.alfredpreferences/workflows/*/info.plist; do
  [ -f "$p" ] || continue
  bid="$(plutil -extract bundleid raw -o - "$p" 2>/dev/null || true)"
  [ "$bid" = "com.graysurf.multi-timezone" ] && dirname "$p"
done | head -n1)"

[ -n "$WORKFLOW_DIR" ] || { echo "multi-timezone workflow not found"; exit 1; }
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "$WORKFLOW_DIR"
echo "ok: removed quarantine from $WORKFLOW_DIR"
```

Notes:

- `workflows/multi-timezone/scripts/script_filter.sh` does best-effort quarantine cleanup on resolved `timezone-cli` path before execution.
- On macOS, local-timezone detection may call `/usr/sbin/systemsetup -gettimezone`; probe failures are non-fatal and continue through fallback chain.
- If all local-timezone probes fail, `timezone-cli` intentionally falls back to `UTC` instead of returning a hard error.
- `workflows/multi-timezone/scripts/action_copy.sh` uses `pbcopy`, so copy action runtime is macOS-only (Linux usage is for CI/test validation).

## Validation

- Re-run quick operator checks after any runtime/config change.
- Recommended workflow check: `bash workflows/multi-timezone/tests/smoke.sh`

## Rollback guidance

Use this when timezone output is unstable or local fallback behavior regresses.

1. Stop rollout of new `multi-timezone` artifacts (pause release/distribution link).
2. Revert Multi Timezone changeset(s), including:
   - `workflows/multi-timezone/`
   - `crates/timezone-cli/`
   - workspace member changes in `Cargo.toml`
   - docs updates tied to rollout (`crates/timezone-cli/docs/workflow-contract.md`, `workflows/multi-timezone/README.md`, `workflows/multi-timezone/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`, and `ALFRED_WORKFLOW_DEVELOPMENT.md` if changed)
3. Rebuild and validate rollback state:
   - `scripts/workflow-lint.sh`
   - `scripts/workflow-test.sh`
   - `scripts/workflow-pack.sh --all`
4. Publish known-good artifact set and post operator notice:
   - Explain that `multi-timezone` is temporarily disabled.
   - Provide ETA/workaround and support contact path.
