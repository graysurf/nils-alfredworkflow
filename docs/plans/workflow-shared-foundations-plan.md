# Plan: Workflow Shared Foundations

## Overview
This plan standardizes shared runtime and test foundations across Alfred workflows so bug fixes are applied once and propagated everywhere. The implementation keeps workflow-specific product semantics local (ranking, wording, provider rules), while centralizing repeated mechanics (helper loading, CLI invocation guards, smoke test scaffolding, and policy audits). Delivery is phased in migration waves to avoid broad regressions and to keep rollback scope small. The end state is one unified development mode for workflows with automated guardrails that prevent old bug classes from reappearing.

## Scope
- In scope: shared shell helper loading, shared script-filter execution driver, shared smoke-test helper library, migration of high-duplication workflows, lint/policy enforcement, CI/release version-source unification.
- In scope: updates to workflow template and development docs so new workflows default to the unified pattern.
- Out of scope: changing workflow-specific search/business behavior, changing Alfred UX copy policy per workflow, rewriting workflow adapters from Bash to another runtime.

## Assumptions (if any)
1. Workflow adapters remain Bash-first and keep current observable behavior contracts.
2. Changes can be delivered as multiple small PRs, not one monolithic refactor.
3. Full workspace lint/test/package gates are available in CI and locally.
4. `plan-tooling`, `jq`, and existing repo scripts remain available on PATH during execution.

## Sprint 1: Foundation Contracts And Shared Primitives
**Goal**: Define hard extraction boundaries and introduce reusable primitives without changing workflow semantics.
**Parallelization**: Tasks 1.2 and 1.3 can run in parallel after task 1.1; task 1.4 depends on 1.1 and can run in parallel with 1.2/1.3 once interfaces are fixed.
**Demo/Validation**:
- Command(s): `plan-tooling validate --file docs/plans/workflow-shared-foundations-plan.md`, `scripts/workflow-lint.sh`
- Verify: new shared helper files exist, are shellcheck-clean, and no placeholder content remains.

### Task 1.1: Publish Shared-Foundation Contract
- **Location**:
  - `docs/specs/workflow-shared-foundations-policy.md`
  - `ALFRED_WORKFLOW_DEVELOPMENT.md`

- **Dependencies**:
  - none
- **Complexity**: 4
- **Acceptance criteria**:
  - Contract explicitly lists allowed shared domains: helper loading, binary resolution, error-row emission, CLI invocation guard, smoke scaffolding.
  - Contract explicitly forbids over-sharing domain mappings and provider-specific query semantics.
  - Migration and rollback constraints are documented and referenced from the global workflow development guide.
- **Validation**:
  - `rg -n "shared foundation|extraction boundary|must stay local|rollback" docs/specs/workflow-shared-foundations-policy.md ALFRED_WORKFLOW_DEVELOPMENT.md`

## Testing Strategy
- Unit: Add shell-level tests for new shared helper modules (`workflow_helper_loader`, `script_filter_cli_driver`) and keep them in lint/test flows.
- Integration: Run migrated workflow smoke scripts in focused batches per sprint, then full `scripts/workflow-test.sh` in Sprint 4.
- E2E/manual: Rebuild/install representative workflows (`google-search`, `weather`, `codex-cli`) and verify Alfred runtime behavior for query, action, and error fallbacks.

## Risks & gotchas
- Over-sharing risk: accidentally moving workflow-specific semantics into shared helpers can break UX contracts.
- Migration churn risk: touching many script files can cause merge conflicts; deliver in small PR waves by workflow family.
- Tooling strictness risk: new audits may create false positives if patterns are not scoped carefully.
- CI drift risk: codex-cli version-source unification can fail if any consumer bypasses the canonical version file.

## Rollback plan
- Keep migration isolated in sequential PR waves (helpers first, then family migrations, then enforcement) so rollback can be path-scoped.
- If runtime regressions occur, revert the affected workflow family paths first (`workflows/<family>/scripts`, `workflows/<family>/tests`) while retaining shared helpers.
- If shared-helper regression is confirmed, revert helper-introduction commits and rerun `scripts/workflow-lint.sh`, `scripts/workflow-test.sh`, and `scripts/workflow-pack.sh --all` before redeploy.
- Reinstall last known-good artifacts from `dist/<workflow>/<version>/` for impacted workflows and document incident details in rollout report.
