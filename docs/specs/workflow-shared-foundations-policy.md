# Workflow Shared Foundations Policy

## Scope

- This document is the canonical policy for shared foundation extraction across Alfred workflows in this repository.
- Shared foundation means cross-workflow runtime mechanics and smoke-test scaffolding that should behave consistently in every workflow.
- This policy governs extraction boundary decisions, migration constraints, and rollback constraints.

## Shared foundation extraction boundary

### Allowed shared foundation domains (normative)

- helper loading
- binary resolution
- error-row emission
- CLI invocation guard
- smoke scaffolding

### Domains that must stay local

- Domain mappings must stay local to each workflow.
- Provider-specific query semantics must stay local to each workflow.
- Workflow-specific ranking, wording, business rules, and provider error interpretation must stay local.

### Explicit over-sharing prohibition

- Do not move domain mappings into shared helpers.
- Do not move provider-specific query semantics into shared helpers.
- If a helper requires workflow/provider branching to function, keep that logic local and expose only a narrow shared primitive.

## Migration constraints

1. Extract only the allowed shared foundation domains listed above; do not broaden scope during migration.
2. Preserve workflow-local behavior contracts while migrating runtime mechanics.
3. Keep workflow adapters thin and local so workflow-specific semantics remain local after extraction.
4. Every migration PR must include targeted validation for affected workflows (lint/test/smoke as applicable).
5. If a migration cannot meet this extraction boundary, stop and keep the logic local.

## Rollback constraints

1. Roll back shared foundation migrations as a coherent unit for affected workflows and shared helper changes.
2. Do not use rollback to introduce shared domain mappings or shared provider-specific query semantics.
3. After rollback, rerun repository workflow validation gates before republishing artifacts.
